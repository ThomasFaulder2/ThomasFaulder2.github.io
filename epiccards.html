    <p>The EPIC cards are flashcards with emergency medicine case studies. The cards were created by Dr Zafar Smith, FACEM, as an educational resource for medical students.</p>
    <p>This app enables you to:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Study the EPIC cards as flashcards.</li>
<li>Search all cards.</li>
<li>View EPIC cards in a PDF format.</li>
<li>Publish your own EPIC cards and leave comments on other students' submissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app allows students to publish case studies. These case studies are stored in an online database. These cases are fictional and cannot be linked back to patients.</p>
